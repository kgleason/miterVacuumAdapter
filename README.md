Miter Saw Dust Port to Vacuum Adapter (OpenSCAD)
This file generates an adapter that allows a miter saw 
dust port to be connected with a shop-vac.  It was specifically 
designed for the Ryobi 12‚Äù Sliding Compound Miter Saw with 
Laser TSS120L and the Shop-Vac 90M300.  It may work with 
other saws and shop-vacs.  The dimensions listed below can 
be modified for use with another miter saw/shop-vac combo.  
Due to the variance in printer calibration and quality, some 
tweaking of the parameters and/or the print may be required 
to be able to print the item.
